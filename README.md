> A bunch of arbitrary benchmarks and fun scripts written with 0 external packages

All of the benchmarks, benchmarking systems and utilities are written from scratch by me. This is how I kill time.

## Running

```bash
# yarn:
$ yarn run start

# NPM:
$ npm run start

# Node:
$ node .
```

> Just a note, `node .` is actually the fastest because it isn't reading the `package.json` file and doing any other startup procedures.
